testkit - A collection of tools for testing
===========================================

This is a simple collection of test tools that have been developed out of need
for some projects. However, some of these tools needed to be duplicated so I
decided to consolidate them in this library.

Features
--------

- Provides a way to use context managers in setup/teardown of a test
- Provides a context manager for temporary directories
- Provides a way to create shunts via fudge

TODO
----

- Add docs
